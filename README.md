# DocuCode

A Node.js CLI with React frontend featuring a fully featured markdown editor and code editor with live npm/css imports and automatic bundling and execution of code in the browser.  Documenting your code was never easier :)

To run the app locally, do:
```
npx docucode@latest serve
```

By default, the app creates a file called notebook.yaml in the directory from which it is run.
You can add an optional filename argument, thusly:

```
npx docucode@latest serve mynotebook
```

There is also a web playground running at docucode.joshualokken.tech.  Have fun!
